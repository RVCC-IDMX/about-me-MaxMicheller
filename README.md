# About Me
Hi my name is Max Micheller.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8c2d0a86-df09-45ab-9ab3-77e0a91280f8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-maxmicheller/deploys)

The following repository is an accumulation of work in which was learned from taking the IDMX 225 - Web Dev 1 Course with Prof. Steve Caruso at Rvcc. In this course we worked on the About Me project which is the contents of the repository attached. We started with learning about file system basics followed with an intro to VS code where we created this project and netlify where we host this on the cloud. Along the way we continued to implement many things like a color scheme, imbeding pictures, making the website scame to multiple devices, how to embed media, creating contact us forms finishing it up with creating a nav bar. In the end I learned about about how to make a web page and gained respect for those in the backend making this sites for everyone to use on the web.

Lets get down to the Color Scheme. I dont think im very good with choosing colors in general, but i went with a swatch of 5 colors.
