            <h2>Embedded static Google map using iFrame</h2>

            <div>


                <p>Embedded static Google map using iFrame sounded like an interesting topic to look into when choosing one to research. To research about it, using google, would be the first step. Finding the documentation for the google maps api which lead me to api keys, but since that isnt what is needed. Just a static map will do. Which was easy enough to do. Just open Google maps, find the location you want to use. Go to share, then embed a map, copy the html and copy that to your website. There are many positive ways you can utalize this, like if you had a website for a small buisness you own. Having a static embed will help people easily find the buisness.</p>

                <!-- Old Lorem Ipsum -->
                <!-- <p>Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you 'as a bagful.'</p>

                <p>Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't put in his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!</p>

                <p>Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.'</p>

                <p>Never mind,' he says. 'I'm used to 'em!'</p>

                <p>Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.</p>

                <p>No' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets of several.' And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walks away. Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'ole hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves here all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at. There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owling stopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round afore turnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And that's all I know for certing."</p>

                <p>Did any one else see anything?"</p>

                <p>One of our gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony, when he sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. At least, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'e never said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all night-a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein' anything. My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead."</p>

                <p>Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf?"</p>

                <p>Well, sir," he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, "I think I can; but I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory."</p>

                <p>Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?"</p>

                <p>WWell then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that 'ere wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out."</p> -->
